## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.hizliresim.com/lt0djiu.jpeg)

The project I worked on during my internship at Gesk Technologies.
I was working on the STM32F429I-DISC0 board, and I was asked to do something related to the LCD on the board. So, I started to create the Flappy Bird game.

Why Flappy Bird:

* It can be played using only the button on the STM32 board. This way, if someone wants to play the game on another STM32 board of the same model, they can do so with just a software installation, without the need to attach any additional hardware to the board.
* The graphic design aspect of the game is quite easy. 
* It's fun to play. :smile:

The project includes images from different screens, and there is also one video.

## Built With

The technologies I used during the project are as follows:

* [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
* [TouchGFX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/touchgfxdesigner.html)

## Getting Started

I will explain how to load the project onto your own board here.

### Prerequisites

You should have STM32CubeIDE and TouchGFX installed on your computer.
The links have been provided in the [Built With](#built-with) section.

### Installation

Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Emirhan58/STM32-FLAPPY-BIRD.git
```



## Usage

After downloading the project to your computer, navigate to the 'STM32CubeIDE' folder inside the project folder and open the '.cproject' file with STM32CubeIDE. Once you have opened the project in the IDE, you can load it onto your STM32F429I-DISC0 board through the IDE.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Emirhan58/STM32-FLAPPY-BIRD/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing
